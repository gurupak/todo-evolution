```text
# Constitution Input for "Evolution of Todo"

## Project Identity

**Project Name:** Evolution of Todo  
**Project Type:** 5-Phase Progressive Hackathon Project  
**Theme:** From CLI to Distributed Cloud-Native AI Systems  
**Development Methodology:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using Agentic Dev Stack  
**Role:** Student acts as Product Architect, using AI to build software without writing boilerplate code

## Project Vision

This project simulates the real-world evolution of software. Starting with a simple in-memory CLI application and progressively evolving to a Kubernetes-managed, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system. Each phase builds upon the previous, demonstrating mastery of Spec-Driven Development.

## The Absolute Constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**NO MANUAL CODE WRITING IS PERMITTED**

This foundational rule defines the entire project:

1. ALL implementation code must be generated by Claude Code through specifications
2. Every feature requires a complete Markdown Spec BEFORE any code generation
3. If Claude Code generates incorrect output, the SPEC must be refined - NEVER edit code manually
4. The review process evaluates: specification quality, prompts used, iteration history, and refinement process
5. Manual code edits disqualify the submission
6. This constraint exists to prove and master Spec-Driven Development as a methodology

There are NO exceptions to this rule.

## Mandatory Development Workflow (Agentic Dev Stack)

Every feature MUST follow this exact sequence without exception:

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Write Spec | Create detailed Markdown specification for the feature |
| 2 | Generate Plan | Use /speckit.plan to create technical implementation plan |
| 3 | Break Tasks | Use /speckit.tasks to decompose into actionable items |
| 4 | Implement | Use /speckit.implement via Claude Code to generate code |
| 5 | Validate | Test generated code against spec requirements |
| 6 | Refine | If incorrect, refine SPEC (never code) and repeat from Step 4 |

All steps must be documented and preserved in specs history folder.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive project constitution v1.0.0 for "Evolution of Todo" hackathon project with the following structure:

**Core Principles Established (7 principles):**
1. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Absolute no-manual-coding constraint
2. Mandatory Development Workflow - 6-step Agentic Dev Stack process
3. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Tests before implementation, 80% coverage minimum
4. Phase-Based Technology Governance - 5 phases with additive technology stack
5. CLI User Experience Excellence - Guided interactions, visual feedback standards
6. Code Quality and Organization Standards - Python & TypeScript standards, error handling
7. Documentation and Traceability Requirements - README per phase, spec preservation

**Key Sections:**
- Project Identity & Vision
- 5-Phase Technology Governance (Python CLI → Full-Stack Web → AI Chatbot → Kubernetes → Cloud)
- Multi-phase project structure with clear directory organization
- Security & Performance Principles (Phase II+)
- Review Criteria Alignment (40% Spec Quality, 30% Code Quality, 20% Functionality, 10% Documentation)
- Governance Rules with version tracking

**Version:** 1.0.0 (initial ratification)  
**File:** `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Sync Impact:**
- Templates already aligned (plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md)
- No follow-up TODOs required
- Constitution ready for immediate use

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution established with 7 core principles governing all 5 phases of development
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (governance document)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to begin Phase 1 feature specifications
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution establishes strict Spec-Driven Development workflow as the foundational constraint, ensuring all code generation follows specification → planning → tasks → implementation cycle with full traceability.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (initial constitution creation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase 1 specification for basic in-memory CLI todo application following the established workflow
